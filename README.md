# musical_tower-dcl
The 2022 Decentraland Game Jam
Our scene is a  Musical tower built from musical notes and scores.

Climbing onto the roof on the music platforms activates a new musical part with overcoming each floor.

After going through all the floors and climbing onto the roof, the player enjoys playing the full music mix.

Depending on which route the player chooses, the final mix may sound different.

*Enjoy your mix
